## Mushroom Classification using Random Forest Classifier
> Safe to eat or deadly poison?

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

    Time period: Donated to UCI ML 27 April 1987.

### Random Forest

A brief introduction of Random Forest Classification algorithm with an image.

---

### About the dataset
A small insight into the dataset. Like what do we plan to do (classify poisonous from non poisonous). What are the different fields. Check the kaggle website.

---

### Approach

Describe the steps taken to implement the classification.
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Some main heading</b><br>
        Description
    </li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ol>

---

### Results
Todo after the implementation part is compelete.
Confusion matrix, Accuracy, loss, etc.

---

### Setup

1. Creating a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Installing the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
